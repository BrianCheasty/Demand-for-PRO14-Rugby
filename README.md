# USING MACHINE LEARNING TO PREDICT ATTENDANCE FOR PRO14 TEAMS
 MSc in Data Analytics model to predict demand for game attendance

The purpose of this research was to establish the forecast accuracy for attendance at all games played by the teams competing in the PRO14 using Machine Learning.  Past actual data was scraped from the internet and split into Train and Test Sets to evaluate the models.  Attendance was also transformed to (log)Attendance and Stadium Percentage.  In total, nine models were created and evaluated using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Based on the results, the Random Forest model performed best with the lowest MAPE of 13.7%, giving a forecast accuracy at 86.3%.  The main contributions of this research are (a) the application of Machine Learning to predict sports attendance and (b) adding Rugby Union to the sports which have been modelled, both do not feature heavily in research.  The literature review establishes common themes for the determinants of attendance and groups them as, Match Level Uncertainty of Outcome, Season Level Uncertainty of Outcome, Long Run Uncertainty of Outcome, Team Quality, Contest Quality, Economic Theory, Quality of Viewing, and Match Details.  The creation of the data set from scraping to engineering features heavily in the methodology section.  Within these determinants,  the recommendation to the teams in the PRO14 is that they should pay particular attention to the following: 
•	The uncertainty of the outcome
•	The Tournament
•	Who is the opposition? especially if it is a derby game
•	The age of their stadium
•	The current economic conditions and consumer sentiment
•	The kick-off time of the game
•	The impact of winning titles
•	Their team's performance in the last three games

All scripts are numbered in order that they should be run
Script 1 needs to be updated with new PRO14 site map before it will run properly
